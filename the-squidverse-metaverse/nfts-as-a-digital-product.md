# NFTs as a Digital Product

NFTs as a product offers verification of ownership through the blockchain and offers a pain-free way to acquire and trade NFTs. Physical NFT cards can be traded in person\* or shipped to any address worldwide. Or they can be digitally traded via their digital form (qNFT).

&#x20;

Initial NFT Marketplace Collaborations:

&#x20;

1\)    OpenSea – ETH & Matic

2\)    Treasure Island – BSc & Matic

3\)    Rarible – ETH

&#x20;

Putting your NFTs in front of millions of buyers.

&#x20;

NFTs purchased from the SQUIDverse Marketplace are minted on major blockchains and leading specialized NFT trading platforms. After purchasing, the NFT (pNFT) is transferred to the specified wallet upon checkout and the physical NFT Card is shipped to the specified address. Our NFTs utilize classes and can be either Real (pNFT, Tangible) or Virtual (rNFT, Intangible).  The latter are represented by editions of the pNFT which are always available and tradable called rNFTs.

Physical NFTs confer rarity in an extraordinary way.

&#x20;

pNFT and perceived value trading model: Adding tangibility to NFT classes serves to increase perceived value and creates a physical tether to which additional NFTs can be valued against. pNFTs carry the highest weighting in Rarity Scoring. pNFTs stored in a secured asset vaults carries an even higher value.

Extrapolations of this concept can provide true value to brand ambassadors, collectors, social media influencers, NFT traders and data for determining the fair market value of any NFT-bound physical item. &#x20;

&#x20;

Own a piece of the moment by trading editions. Editions are NFTs that are part of a physical item. Not just cross-chain, cross-NFT as well.

&#x20;

In SQUID token’s case, digital products sold on our marketplace will generate FIAT which will be routed via SQUID token LP Holdings (BNB, ETH OR MATIC) to either trigger mint NFTs or add liquidity (See above for allocation strategy for the Comet Fund).

&#x20;

o   Triple-Investment NFT Model: 1/3 of the transaction will be issued in $SQUID tokens and the other 1/3 will be used to create the digital record of the value exchange on the blockchain in the native token (ETH/BNB/MATIC). This constitutes a “Buy Event” on the respective NFT marketplace from the SQUID Repo on that Marketplace. The final 1/3 will be used to cover transaction fees, minting and gas fees.

o   ShipMint: Your SQUID NFT Card will be shipped to the specified address upon checkout and the NFT will be fulfilled simultaneously. Fulfillment of the NFT will involve the complete transfer of ownership of the pNFT to the owner’s specified BEP-20 or ERC-20 enabled web3 wallet e.g. MetaMask or TrustWallet that is connected to that marketplace.

o   SQUID NFT Cards– the pNFT contains a redeemable code (SCode) that can be used to redeem a qNFT from the SQUID Vault. Redemption of the qNFT results in a “Transfer Event” that transfers the qNFT from the SQUID Vault to a private wallet. This is the final point of the transaction model and can be replicated with any item.
