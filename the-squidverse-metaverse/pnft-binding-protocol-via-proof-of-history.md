# pNFT Binding Protocol via Proof of History

Each pNFT will have a unique hexadecimal code (SCode) that will be embedded onto the card/item. The SCode will verify ownership of the FIAT value exchange through blockchain augmentation. The SCode is a dual-codex which codifies the FIAT txID and the original transaction minting (qCode). A version of this code is printed on the pNFT. To pass authenticity testing, the SCode can be validated through an online validator. The qCode will only be issued to the original buyer of the NFT.
