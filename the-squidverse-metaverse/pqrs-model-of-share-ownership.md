# pqrs Model of Share Ownership

A new model must be created to create a system of value exchange that intermingles with the blockchain which seamlessly adds value to NFTs in the form of physicality via rarity and allows appreciation and frictionless trading while maintaining a physical store of wealth. This leverages the advantage and benefits of tangibility with those of the intangible and combines them both in an extraordinary way.

So technically, 3 iterations of the NFT exists. The SQUID NFT Card (physical card is shipped to buyer which contains the SCode), the pNFT (generated from the sale of the physical card produces the SCode) and a third class the qNFT (generated upon redemption of a the SCode with a qCode). Complete ownership is where you have all 3. Shared ownership where you own the pNFT and someone else possesses the physical item or qNFT. Partial ownership is where you own the edition version of the NFT, You own part of the experience.
