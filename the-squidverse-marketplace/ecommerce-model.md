eCommerce Model:

&#x20;

o   Token Buyback Model: The comet fund will be continuously replenished by liquidity provided via sales from the SQUIDverse NFT+ Marketplace. This generates positive buying pressure which keeps prices stable and increases token visibility by attracting major exchanges. It also encourages a rising price floor to ensure investors are protected from large market swings.

o   SQUID Token Cards: Tokens are generated through token trading activity or trading volume which is in turn used to route tokens to buyers from the Marketplace who will receive them upon redeeming their tokens from their verified purchases.

o   SQUID Token NFT Products: NFT Token Products are paired to the owner on the blockchain it was minted on. Buying tokenized physical or digital NFTs will trigger a transfer event from the SQUIDverse Vault account via one of our NFT Partners and then a NFT will be transferred to the buyer’s specified wallet address. The physicalized NFT (pNFT) will be shipped to buyer’s physical specified address.
