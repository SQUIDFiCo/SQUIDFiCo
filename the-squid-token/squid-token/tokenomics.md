# Tokenomics

A major focus of many de-fi projects have been to create a static reward system combined with deflation. We’re taking that one step further. Tokenomics 2.0 is a new way to incentivize holding while maximizing rewards.

&#x20;

The SQUID Token employs powerful tokenomics that are designed to create value for all vested partners and parties. SQUID Token has a low transaction fee structure of 6% that is designed to optimize early adoption with long-term capital preservation by holding incentivization and negative selling pressure.

**Volumetric Transaction Burning**

SQUID Token is deflationary and has a fixed supply. Every interaction with the smartcontract will burn tokens. This drives scarcity while token accumulation and distribution occur. Over time, the entire liquidity pool will be controlled by the community.

&#x20;

Deflation is a powerful tool to offer increased value through manipulation of supply-demand economics. Deflation at the beginning of projects has a larger impact on the price action.

&#x20;

Deflationary pressure serves a couple purposes:

·      This will bolster the price of SQUID Token and ensure that its value appreciates over time bringing value to Investors and incentivizes long-term holding.

·      Anti-Inflation: No new tokens can be minted preventing the possibility of diluting the market cap and dumping.

&#x20;

The goal of SQUID Token is to become a repo of wealth worthy of the cosmos. Our token’s value is also bonded to tangible pieces (pNFTs). This makes the SQUID Token a store of tangible and intangible wealth (qNFTs). This ensures that over time both our pNFTs and qNFTs increase in value over time.

&#x20;

**Deflationary Function**

As a project matures, returns will decrease since new holders are psychologically less inclined to buy scarcer tokens at a higher price. To combat this, we’ve created a decreasing deflationary function that is inversely correlated to the token reward system.

**Rewards Function**

Our transaction fee structure is volume dependent and therefore attracting new adopters after launch and into the next year will be key. As deflation slows down, dynamic rewards will increase in the exact proportion that deflation has decreased. This will form a local golden cross where older holders who have benefitted from increased price action will now benefit from the same increase in token rewards while new adopters can benefit from future deflation and larger rewards.
