# Introduction

**Yeah, I know what you’re thinking. Not another community token promising the space and moon. But wait, hear us out for a second. We’re a group of crypto enthusiasts and investors from around the planet. Our backgrounds and skillsets are diverse and we’re constantly growing. We’re creating a community of investors that will seek to empower the retail trader and draw institutional interest through fidelity. We’re creating a community of investors, truly run by our community.**\

**We’re making De-Fi safe and rewarding in an extraordinary way. Our development community will constantly grow, taking in people from around the world. The USA, UK, Russia, China, India and everywhere in between.  That’s the whole point of crypto. Liberating people, creating opportunity, and leveling the gap of inequity between the rich and the poor, no matter where you come from. If you believe in those ideals, you know why you invested in crypto in the first place.**

**It’s what led you to invest your savings into Bitcoin and keep it invested for years despite multiple large corrections and bear markets. And even so, some of you are still up 40000% and that’s just cause crypto is not just an investment. It’s a technology that’s designed to replace the legacy FIAT system. And it’s still nascent. As the technology continues to unfurl, we’re going to see the cryptoverse converge further and further with the tangible real world. Slowly seeping into reality and becoming a part of the greatest value exchange system that mankind has ever created.**

**When we look to the future, the tech we develop now as a collective will be the bones upon which the muscles of the future exert mankind’s collective effort to push our reach far beyond earth. The final frontier of space is coming closer and closer to being conquered by humanity. We created SQUID Finance to help make that transition and gather people who see the same vision for the future. So yea, if you’re not technically savy you could probably stop reading here and just ape in now. If you are a blockchain expert and you’ve read this far, you know what we’re creating. If you’re an investor and you missed out on adopting Bitcoin in 2011, don’t worry. DeFi startups have a history of outperforming Btc by thousands of percent.**

**Strap up. We’ve got our missions ready.**
