# Investment Models

INVESTMENT Model:

&#x20;

o   **The Tentacle Fiat Protocol:** The tentacle fiat protocol is a term used to encapsulate multiple routes of fiat liquidity generation outside of the blockchain trading pairs. This includes 100% of the net-profits generated by the SQUIDverse NFT+ Marketplace.

o   As the prices of various portfolio assets rise, portions will be reinvested and then a small amount will be turned into stablecoins tethered to SQUID token. As external market prices fall, stablecoin reserves will be used to expand investments in selected assets.

o   Asset prices will be continuously monitored to make purchases at the best available price. Crypto Assets will be dynamically purchased and reported quarterly and annually.

&#x20;

The following assets have been identified for strategic allocations in addition to our holdings of Binance Coin:

&#x20;

o   Bitcoin

o   Ethereum

o   Cardano

o   Matic (Polygon)

o   Solana

&#x20;

The largest portion of our portfolio will be held in Binance Coin (BNB) and Bitcoin (BTC) followed by proportional investments in Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) , MATIC and other DeFi startups.

&#x20;

**The Comet Investment Fund will be used to create and fund ventures that bring awareness to blockchain and space innovation. It will be used to create downstream investments that would seek to create opportunities for partnerships with other blockchain projects.**

o   Percentage Appreciation through volume generation from dynamic rewards.

Passive Income rewards paid out through SQUID tokens, calculated daily, and applied instantly on every transaction through the smartcontract.

Diversified Funds

Tokens in the Comet Investment Fund will be spread across a mixture of low and medium-risk pools, along with one or two high-risk/high-reward pools to bring the average APR up overall without increasing the risk profile of our portfolio to an unacceptably high level. The list of pools will be changed automatically as yields increase/decrease, to ensure we are always invested into the best paying farms in the low/medium/high risk categories. Over time, the number of farms in our pool will increase, allowing us to scalp the best rates available and boost the overall returns to investors.

&#x20;

Risk Management

Yield farming will never be a zero-risk investment and there will always be the possibility of lower-than-expected yields or loss, but with SQUIDvest we can reduce these risks and create a steadier, lower-volatility return through institutional technical analysis and consultation.
